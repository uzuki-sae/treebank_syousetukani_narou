# treebank_syousetukani_narou
It's a treebank to search any syntax tree in the corpus for online novel site "小説になろう" .
You need get GiNZA and sudachi as tokenizer.
In my case I just test in Re:ゼロから始める異世界生活 for test. I have not test in the full corpus. So there is only data for Re:0 in tree.json.
Get a corpus by crawling or any way before make a treebank.
